## Coding task 2. Find subarray with given sum.
   
Given an unsorted array of non-negative integers. Write a function which returns **true** if there is a **continuous** subarray
which adds to a given number (target sum). Estimate the complexity of your code.

**Example:**

Input: [1,2,3,4] and target sum is 7
Output: true
Explanation: Sum of subarray [3,4] is 7


### Running

There is no main to run this, instead there are test cases defined [here](../../../../../../test/groovy/com/bramlettny/alpha/test2/Test2Spec.groovy)
